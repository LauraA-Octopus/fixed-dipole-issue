I have a model of a PSF (point spread function) all coded up in Python. This is mortensen.py. I have a different model coded up in MATLAB, all within the folder 'hinterer'. I would like to integrate the MATLAB model into the Python script so that I can use it, if I so choose, instead of the current model. Maybe it should be in a class called something like dipdistr_hinterer. It should be able to work within MLEwT just as the current model is able to. Maybe this could be achieved through the use of some input flag, like model='mortensen' when the original is to be used, or model='hinterer' when the new model is to be used. And make everything python3 while you're at it. May I attach a folder containing the two sets of code?
